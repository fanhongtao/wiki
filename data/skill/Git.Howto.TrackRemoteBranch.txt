A 'tracking branch' in Git is a local branch that is connected to a remote branch. When you push and pull on that branch, it automatically pushes and pulls to the remote branch that it is connected with.

Use this if you always pull from the same upstream branch into the new branch, and if you don't want to use "git pull " explicitly.

The 'git clone' command automatically sets up a 'master' branch that is a tracking branch for 'origin/master' - the master branch on the cloned repository.

You can create a tracking branch manually by adding the '--track' option to the 'branch' command in Git.
{{{
git branch --track experimental origin/experimental
}}}

Then when you run:
{{{
$ git pull experimental
}}}

It will automatically fetch from 'origin' and merge 'origin/experimental' into your local 'experimental' branch.

Likewise, when you push to origin, it will push what your 'experimental' points to to origins 'experimental', without having to specify it.

----
After I added a remote named 'local' to an existing repository, and ran the pull command, I got:
{{{
$ git pull local
remote: Counting objects: 7, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Total 4 (delta 3), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), done.
From e:/Git/repo/utils
   57b15b0..6c217c7  master     -> local/master
You asked to pull from the remote 'local', but did not specify
a branch. Because this is not the default configured remote
for your current branch, you must specify a branch on the command line.
}}}

To solve this problem, I use the following command to make local branch 'master' as a 'tracking branch' to repository 'local'.
{{{
$ git branch --set-upstream master local/master
Branch master set up to track remote branch master from local.
}}}

After that, I run pull again, this time, it works.
{{{
$ git pull
