!!!Selecting Tests

!!Listing Test Names
Sometimes it is necessary to list the available tests in a program before running them so that a filter may be applied if needed. Including the flag --gtest_list_tests overrides all other flags and lists tests in the following format:

{{{
TestCase1.
  TestName1
  TestName2
TestCase2.
  TestName
}}}

None of the tests listed are actually run if the flag is provided. There is no corresponding environment variable for this flag.

Availability: Linux, Windows, Mac.

!! Running a Subset of the Tests
By default, a Google Test program runs all tests the user has defined. Sometimes, you want to run only a subset of the tests (e.g. for debugging or quickly verifying a change). If you set the GTEST_FILTER environment variable or the --gtest_filter flag to a filter string, Google Test will only run the tests whose full names (in the form of TestCaseName.TestName) match the filter.

The format of a filter is a ':'-separated list of wildcard patterns (called the positive patterns) optionally followed by a '-' and another ':'-separated pattern list (called the negative patterns). A test matches the filter if and only if it matches any of the positive patterns but does not match any of the negative patterns.

A pattern may contain '*' (matches any string) or '?' (matches any single character). For convenience, the filter '*-NegativePatterns' can be also written as '-NegativePatterns'.

For example:

{{{
./foo_test Has no flag, and thus runs all its tests.
./foo_test --gtest_filter=* Also runs everything, due to the single match-everything * value.
./foo_test --gtest_filter=FooTest.* Runs everything in test case FooTest.
./foo_test --gtest_filter=*Null*:*Constructor* Runs any test whose full name contains either "Null" or "Constructor".
./foo_test --gtest_filter=-*DeathTest.* Runs all non-death tests.
./foo_test --gtest_filter=FooTest.*-FooTest.Bar Runs everything in test case FooTest except FooTest.Bar.
}}}

Availability: Linux, Windows, Mac.
