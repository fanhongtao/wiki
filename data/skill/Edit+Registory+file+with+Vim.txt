Windows registry files (*.REG) are encoded in UTF-16le with BOM. So we need to config vim to read registry files correctly.

Add the following lines to vimrc file.
{{{
set encoding=utf-8
set fileencodings=ucs-bom,utf-8,cp936
}}}
Note, the __ucs-bom__ must set before __utf-8__.

My windows's default language is zh_CN. The setting of encoding to utf-8 will cause vim display message in the wrong way. To solve this problem, set the environment variable __LANG__ to __en_US.UTF-8__.
{{{
set LANG=en_US.UTF-8
}}}
