!!Basic commands
IRC using a __command line__ way to chat, so we need to remember some basic commands.

One thing need to be remembered is that all the command is started with a slash ('/').

Here is some commands I've ever used.

|| Command || Description || Demo of usage
| /attach \\ /server | connect to a IRC server | /attach irc.freenode.net \\ /server irc.freenode.net \\  /server freenode
| /join \\ /j | Join a channel | /join #jspwiki \\ /j #jspwiki
| /leave | Leave the channel | /leave
| /whois | Displays information about a user | /whois Dharma
| /clear | Clear the current view | /clear
| /away | Leaving away for a while. | /away \\ /away For dinner
| /back | Back again. | /back

All these commands are tested in ChatZila.
