!!!Design Principle

All patterns provide a way to let some parts of a system vary independently of all other parts.


!!1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same
In other words, if you've got some aspect of your code that is changing, say with every new requirement, then you know you've got a behavior that needs to be pulled out and separated from all the stuff that doesn't change.

Here's another way to think about this principle: ''__take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those that don't__''.
