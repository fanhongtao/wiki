This page describes how to set up some simple access control scenarios, using the new security features of JSPWiki version 2.4.

!!Setting up a Sample Wiki Group
Suppose you've got a page that you'd like to restrict access to. You've got a page called {{TestSocialCommittee}}, and you'd like to lock it down so that only the {{SocialCommittee}} wiki group can access it. Here's how to do it.

First, make sure you've created a wiki profile. Create a user with these properties:
* ''login name:'' arj
* ''wiki name:'' AndrewJaquith
* ''full name:'' Andrew Jaquith

Next, once you've logged in as arj, create a new wiki group by clicking on the "create group" link ({{NewGroup.jsp}}. Give the group these properties:
* ''group name:'' SocialCommittee
* ''members:'' Andrew Jaquith

After you save the group, it will be saved to a group called {{SocialCommittee}}. You can verify that it has the correct membership (you!) by opening the group {{SocialCommittee}} and clicking on the "edit page" link. The URL for this is {{Group.jsp?group=SocialCommittee}}. 

So far so good; we've created the group we need. Now we create our test page and add an ACL to it. Edit the URL at the top of the page so that the right-most part of it reads {{Edit.jsp?page=TestSocialCommittee}}. You should see the editor page, with an empty page (blank content). Add the following text:
{{{[{ALLOW view SocialCommittee}]
Only the group SocialCommittee can see this.}}}

Now log out. Try navigating to the {{TestSocialCommittee}} page. Access to the page will be denied, and you will be prompted to log in.

Log in. Try Navigating to {{TestSocialCommittee}} again. You should see the text: {{Only the group SocialCommittee can see this}}..

So there you have it.

!!Granting Expanded Default Privileges to a Wiki Group
Releases 2.3.83 and higher of JSPWiki include the ability to grant permissions to wiki groups, in addition to (or as a substitute for) entries in each page access control lists. For example, you can grant edit privileges on the page {{Main}} of wiki {{MyWiki}} to the group {{SocialCommittee}} by modifying your {{jspwiki.policy}} file as follows:
{{{grant signedBy "jspwiki",
  principal com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.GroupPrincipal "SocialCommittee" {
    permission com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.permissions.PagePermission "MyWiki:Main", "edit";
};}}}
You can grant permission to collections of pages, too. Here's a permission that allows editing for any page on MyWiki with the prefix "SocialCommittee":
{{{permission com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.permissions.PagePermission "MyWiki:SocialCommittee*", "edit";}}}

!!Designating an Administrator Group
JSPWiki ships by default without a designated wiki administrator account, although the {{Install.jsp}} installer will create one when you run it. But it's easy to grant administrative privileges to a wiki group. For example, you grant administrative privileges to a wiki group called "WikiAdmins" as follows:
{{{grant signedBy "jspwiki",
  principal com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.GroupPrincipal "WikiAdmins" {
    permission com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.permissions.AllPermission "JSPWiki";
};}}}
