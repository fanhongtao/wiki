This is the official documentation wiki for the JSPWiki 2.4.x, 2.6.x and 2.8.x series.  Anything which is not documentation should be directed to the [Official JSPWiki site|http://www.jspwiki.org].  Any support questions on this site will be mercilessly refactored or removed.

Only some of the documentation from this site will be included with the distribution.  Please list the pages that should be included in [DistributionDocumentation].

To try out JSPWiki features, please visit our [Sandbox Wiki|http://sandbox.jspwiki.org], which is an open wiki which gets wiped clean regularly.
