There are some differences from other:  * It shows the headings structure of the main content and of other document embedded through IFRAME element or those which are part of a series of FRAMES (FRAMESET). * It shows all headings in the document, including those hidden with CSS techniques or those without content. * It can warn when there are no headings in the document. * It can warn when there are skipping level in the headings structure. * It is an index for acc_slide (or rumo_slides) and for HTML Slidy (W3C). * When an item is selected, the heading will be highlighted, so you can identify.  So this is useful not only to facilitate navigation to anyone, but also to help webdevelopers, consultants and auditors.
