! Bulleted lists
Use an asterisk (*) in the first column to make bulleted lists. Use more asterisks for deeper indentation. 

This

{{{
* One \\ one and a half
* Two
* Three
** Three.One}}}

produces this

* One \\ one and a half
* Two
* Three
** Three.One

----

! Numbered lists
Just like with bulleted lists, but use a hash (#) instead of the asterisk.

This

{{{
# One
# Two
# Three
## Three.One
}}}

produces this

# One
# Two
# Three
## Three.One

Errmm.. is is posible to create a list without any numbers or dots? just a indentation?!

--Matty, 15-Mar-2007

Yes.  Try the following:

{{{
;:one
;:two
;:three
}}}

which will result in 

;:one
;:two
;:three


Okay this works for me... but what about a double indentation...?! {{{;:;:}}} dont works :(

That gets more complicated.  But it's possible:

{{{
%%(margin-left:1ex;)
First indent
%%(margin-left:1ex;)
Second indent
%%(margin-left:1ex;)
Third indent
%%
Back to second\\
Still in second
%%
Back to first.
%%
}}}
Result is like this:
%%(margin-left:1ex;)
First indent
%%(margin-left:1ex;)
Second indent
%%(margin-left:1ex;)
Third indent
%%
Back to second\\
Still in second
%%
Back to first.
%%

Is it possible to mark a listitem as a heading means that the listitem is shown in the table of contents...

Simple.  No :-)

Is it possible to have a numbered list with preformatted text that can copy/pasted without losing the embedded newlines? For example, copy/pasting the block with two cp commands shows that it's all one line. This is solved by having the triple-brace on it's own line but that restarts list numbering

Example 1:
# Run cp{{{
In this, newlines are missing when copied and pasted into a text editor
$ cp file1 file2
$ cp file2 file3
}}}
# Run ls{{{
$ ls -l file1 file2 file3
}}}

Example 2:
# Run cp
{{{
In this, newlines are NOT missing when copied and pasted into a text editor.
But the second item in the list (with ls) starts at 1 again
$ cp file1 file2
$ cp file2 file3
}}}
# Run ls{{{
$ ls -l file1 file2 file3
}}}
