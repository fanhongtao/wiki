!!Counter
A simple counter that starts counting at 1 at the top of the page, and each time it is invoked, will increase its value.  
These counters are transient, and relevant to the current page view only - i.e. two persons viewing the same page at the same time get their own counters.

The current counter value is accessible also as a [WikiVariable].  The name of the variable is "counter", or "counter-<name>", if you have defined a counter name.

* __start__ = ''value'' (Since 2.8) The starting value of the count, the default value = 0. This parameter is optional.
* __showResult__ = ''true/false'' (Since 2.8) Can be true or false, and determines if the counter value should be visible on the page, the default is true. This parameter is optional.
