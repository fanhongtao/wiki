!! Description

__Page Permission__ is a permitted action on a particular target page or set of pages:

* view
* edit
* comment
* rename
* upload
* delete
* modify


!! Implied Permissions

Certain permissions imply others:

* The "comment" PagePermission implies "view"
* The "upload" PagePermission implies "view"
* The "edit" PagePermission implies "view" and "comment"
* The "modify" PagePermission implies "edit" and "upload"
* The "delete" PagePermission implies "modify"
* Up to v2.4, "rename" PagePermission implies "modify". From v2.6 on, this is no longer the case - implies "edit" (see [http://www.jspwiki.org/wiki/NewIn2.6]).
