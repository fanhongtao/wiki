Many Americans know these words from the Declaration of Independence by heart:

{{{
“We hold these truths to be self-evident,that all men are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
that among these are Life,Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”
}}}

This means that all people are born with the same basic rights. Government does not create these rights, and no government can take these rights away.
