[Robert Anson Heinlein|Wikipedia:Robert_A._Heinlein], one of or perhaps simply the most popular, influential, and controversial authors of science fiction of the 20th Century. He wrote [Stranger in a Strange Land|Wikipedia:Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land], and the novels of the same name which were the basis for [Starship Troopers|Wikipedia:Starship_Troopers] and [The Puppet Masters|Wikipedia:The_Puppet_Masters], along with around 30 other books.

Some of his quotes:

* One can judge from experiment, or one can blindly accept authority. To the scientific mind, experimental proof is all important and theory is merely a convenience in description, to be junked when it no longer fits. To the academic mind, authority is everything and facts are junked when they do not fit theory laid down by authority.

* TANSTAAFL (The acronym, not the words they stand for)

* A "critic" is a man who creates nothing and thereby feels qualified to judge the work of creative men. There is logic in this; he is unbiased — he hates all creative people equally.

* A generation which ignores history has no past — and no future.

* Always listen to experts. They'll tell you what can't be done, and why. Then do it.

* Being intelligent is not a felony. But most societies evaluate it as at least a misdemeanor.

* The 3-legged stool of understanding is held up by history, languages, and mathematics. Equipped with these three you can learn anything you want to learn. But if you lack any one of them you are just another ignorant peasant with dung on your boots.
